# Prototypes vs. classes

It was mentioned throughout the course that Javascript is a mostly functional language with object oriented features thrown in. Today we'll explore how these features work and why Javascript only recently (as in ES6) became a _truly_ object oriented language in the traditional sense.

## What is OOP again?

[Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is one of many ways to write programs. The technical definition can be found on the link above, but the TL;DR is that you create templates - _classes_ - used to represent your data structures consistently along with functions - _methods_ - that act upon them.

Each piece of data based on a class is called an _object_ or _instance_, and will **always** have the same properties and methods. In the end you have neat and consistent packages of data with attached behaviours.

## ES5 and `Object`

If you've used other object oriented languages in the past, you know Javascript uses the word `object` a lot, but...

JS objects are mostly key-value pairs. But because of Javascript's functional nature, you can store functions inside variables, pass them around as arguments and return functions from other functions. One of the many side effects of this behaviour is the ability to store functions within objects:

```js
const myCar = {
  make: 'Ford',
  model: 'Fiesta',
  color: 'Rust',
  state: 'rekt',
  drive: function() {
    if (this.state === 'rekt') {
      console.log(`Are you serious? This car is ${this.state}!`)
    }
    else {
      console.log('VROOOOOOM!')
    }
  }
}

// I can also add keys at will
myCar.fix = function() {
  console.log("IT'S ABOUT TIME!")
  this.state = "Fine, I guess."
}
```

This kinda sorta looks like a traditional OOP object, but it lacks the ability to create multiple copies that act the same way - not to mention the data structure can be changed at will by absolutely anyone. Inconceivable!

#### What about constructor functions?

There's another way to create objects which _looks_ like it's addressing this problem:

```js
// This is a constructor function, designed to be used with the `new` keyword.
// Notice how each property is assigned to `this`
function Apple(type) {
  this.type = type;
  this.color = "red";
  this.getInfo = function() {
    return this.color + ' ' + this.type + ' apple';
  };
}

var myApple = new Apple('macintosh');
myApple.color = "reddish";

console.log(myApple.getInfo());
//=> "reddish macintosh apple"

// All's good so far! Now we sneakily change Apple.getInfo().
// Someone with OOP background could think this would alter the behaviour
// of all objects created with `new Apple(...)` ...
Apple.getInfo = function() {
  return "LOL I'VE CHANGED THIS!";
}

// ...but no!
console.log(myApple.getInfo());
//=> "red macintosh apple"
```

And this is where we finally reach our main subject!

## `Object.prototype`

It turns out there **is** a way to make a _template_ to create multiple objects **and** ensure all objects will be modified at once when the template is changed. This is used by all native Javascript objects - `String`, `Number`, `Array` and so on.

Sticking to our Apple example:

```js
// We start more or less the same way...
function Apple(type) {
  this.type = type;
  this.color = "red";
}

// ...then we add a twist
Apple.prototype.getInfo = function() {
  return this.color + ' ' + this.type + ' apple';
};

var apple1 = new Apple('macintosh');
var apple2 = new Apple('gala');

console.log(apple2.getInfo());
//=> "red gala apple"

// Instead of changing Apple directly, we change Apple.prototype
Apple.prototype.getInfo = function() {
  return "LOLOLOL NOPE"
};

// This actually does what we expect!

console.log(apple1.getInfo());
//=> "LOLOLOL NOPE"

console.log(apple2.getInfo());
//=> "LOLOLOL NOPE"
```

The `prototype` is the template used by all objects based the "master" object. This is called [prototypal inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) and it was the _only_ way to create something resembling an OOP class for the longest time.

## Classes

ES6 finally brought actual OOP to Javascript with classes and inheritance. If we'd try to recreate the Apple example above with classes, it would look something like this:

```js
class Apple {
  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type
    this.color = "red"
  }

  getInfo() {
    return `${this.color} ${this.type} apple`
  }
}

const apple1 = new Apple('macintosh')
const apple2 = new Apple('gala')

console.log(apple1.getInfo())
//=> "red macintosh apple"

console.log(apple2.getInfo())
//=> "red gala apple"
```

So much better! It's also possible to mark a class function (usually called a **method**) as a _getter_ or a _setter_. This makes it possible to use these methods as if they were properties:

```js
class Apple {
  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type
    this.color = "red"
    this.delicious = false
  }

  get description() {
    return `${this.color} ${this.type} apple`
  }

  set taste(howItTastes) {
    this.delicious = Boolean(howItTastes.match(/good|awesome|sweet|delicious/i))
  }
}

const apple = new Apple('gala')

apple.description // calls the description() getter
//=> "red gala apple"

apple.taste = 'awesome' // calls the taste() setter
apple.delicious         // which changes this.delicious
//=> true
```

And if we wanted to make things interesting adding inheritance:

```js
class GalaApple extends Apple {
  constructor() {
    super('gala') // Calls the method with same name on the parent class
  }
}

const myApple = new GalaApple()

apple.description
//=> "red gala apple"
```

In reality, JS classes are simply _syntatic sugar_ for prototypes - in other words, prorotypes are **always** used internally to implement OOP features. You don't need to worry about this 99% of the time, but it doesn't hurt to be aware of it.

## Code

You can find simple OOP code examples inside [`/code`](code) showing off simple concepts like inheritance, getters and setters.
